# Unix-based-System-Forensics-Project
Created an Incident Response Tool for my Unix-based System Forensics Project
usage:
* Download genIRator directory
* Run the genIRator.sh as root
* all incident response reports, hashes and volatile memory dump will be in the genIRator directory
* all dependencies are self contained, however the host linux box will need linux-headers installed
